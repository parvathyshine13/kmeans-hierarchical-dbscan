# Clustering Analysis: K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN for EastWest Airlines


## Dataset and Preprocessing
- Handled missing values through imputation or removal.
- Detected and treated outliers to ensure data quality.
- Scaled features when necessary for improved clustering performance.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and potential clusters.
- Used visualizations to reveal underlying data structures and inform parameter selection.

---

## Clustering Algorithms Implementation
- Implemented the following clustering methods using Python (with scikit-learn) or MATLAB:
  - **K-Means Clustering**
  - **Hierarchical Clustering** (varied linkage criteria)
  - **DBSCAN** (density-based clustering)
- Experimented with different parameter settings:
  - K-Means: Used Elbow method to determine optimal number of clusters (K).
  - Hierarchical: Tested different linkage criteria (e.g., single, complete, average).
  - DBSCAN: Tuned epsilon (neighborhood size) and minPts (minimum points per cluster).
- Applied algorithms to the preprocessed dataset to identify natural groupings.

## Cluster Analysis and Interpretation
- Analyzed characteristics of each cluster generated by the algorithms.
- Interpreted insights such as cluster size, compactness, and separation.
- Compared results across different clustering methods to understand their strengths and weaknesses.

---

## Visualization
- Visualized clusters using scatter plots and other relevant charts.
- Differentiated clusters by color to clearly show separation and boundaries.
- Used plots to validate clustering results and identify any overlapping clusters.

---

## Evaluation and Performance Metrics
- Evaluated clustering quality using internal metrics, primarily the **Silhouette Score** for K-Means and DBSCAN.
- Discussed clustering effectiveness based on metric values and visual assessments.
- Compared metrics to select the best performing algorithm and parameters.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python 3.x  
- Scikit-learn (clustering algorithms, evaluation metrics)  
- Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)  
- Jupyter Notebook (analysis documentation)
